# Feature-Detection-Public

As part of my computer vision course, I implemented a feature detection and matching program. The goal of feature detection and matching is to identify a pairing between a point in one image and a corresponding point in another image. These correspondences can then be used to stitch multiple images together into a panorama. In this project, I wrote code to detect discriminating features, which are reasonably in- variant to translation, rotation, and illumination, in an image and find the best matching features in another image.

Unfortunately, since this is a school project, I cannot show any code of my implementation.
